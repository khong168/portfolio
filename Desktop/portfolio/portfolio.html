    <p><em>Welcome to my world.</em> How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Son of a gun. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Now then, let's play. Let's build an almighty mountain.</p>
    <h2>All About Me</h2>
      <p><strong>My background</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Education
            <ol>
              <li>Once upon a time, i made it through college and have a BA in graphic design.</li>
              <li>After years of brain atrophy, challenging myself to learn coding at Epicodus!</li>
            </ol>
          <li>Job Experience</li>
            <ol>
              <li>Too many jobs to count, bouncing around designing tshirt graphics for this company and that company.</li>
              <li>Landed a soul crushing job at a corporate monster, stayed too long and got too comfortable, too complacent and unfortunatly, too unhappy.</li>
            </ol>
          <li>Epicodus Inspiration<li/>
            <ol>
              <li>I want to update my grey matter, learn something difficult, and to challenge my brain</li>
              <li>Break out of my comfort zone, be a novice and feel okay about knowing nothing!</li>
              <li>I feel like a dinosaur in regards to skills set, i want to be part of the future and grow my skills.</li>
              <li>I like to make things, but strive to be a minimilist. Building useful applications or websites without creating waste sounds awesome.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Hobbies</li>
            <ol>
              <li>Climbing</li>
              <li>Biking</li>
              <li>Aerial Trapeze and Silk</li>
              <li>Handstands</li>
              <li>Tai-Chi</li>
              <li>Gardening</li>
            </ol>
            
              <p>Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. You can spend all day playing with mountains. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are.We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Now it's beginning to make a little sense.</p>
