    <p><em>Welcome to my world.</em> How to paint. <strong>That's easy.</strong> What to paint. That's much harder. Son of a gun. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Now then, let's play. Let's build an almighty mountain.</p>
      <h2 class="wings">All About Me</h2>

        <li><span class="fancy">Education</span></li>
          <ol>
            <li>Once upon a time, i made it through college and have a BA in graphic design.</li>

          </ol>
        <li><span class="fancy">Job Experience</span></li>
          <ol>
            <li>Too many jobs to count, bouncing around designing tshirt graphics for this company and that company.</li>
            <li>Landed a soul crushing job at a corporate monster, stayed too long and got too comfortable, too complacent and unfortunatly, too unhappy.</li>
          </ol>
        <li><span class="fancy">Reasons for Epicodus</span></li>
          <ol>
            <li>I want to update my grey matter, learn something difficult, and to challenge my brain</li>
            <li>Break out of my comfort zone, be a novice and feel okay about knowing nothing!</li>
            <li>I feel like a dinosaur in regards to skills set, i want to be part of the future and grow my skills.</li>
            <li>I like to make things, but strive to be a minimilist. Building useful applications or websites without creating waste sounds awesome.</li>

      <h2 class="wings">A few extra words</h2>
    </div>
      <p class="happy">Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. You can spend all day playing with mountains. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are.We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Now it's beginning to make a little sense.</p>

  <p class="happy"><em>Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it</em> should be. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life.You can create anything that makes you happy. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. Anything you want to do you can do here.</p>
