            <h3>Through The Woods</h3>
          </div>
            <p class="happy">Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. You can spend all day playing with mountains. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/12/what-does-it-mean-to-see-with-the-minds-eye/383345/">What's in your mind?</a>. Now it's beginning to make a little sense.</p>
            <p class="lead">You have to make those little noises or it won't work. <mark>Absolutely no pressure</mark>. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. The light is your friend. Preserve it. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. There we go. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time.</p>

          <p class="happy"><em>Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it</em> should be. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life.You can create anything that makes you happy. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. Anything you want to do you can do here.</p>
